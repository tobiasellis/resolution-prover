HOW TO EXECUTE:

javac Main.java 
java Main <path_to_kb_file>

HOW TO CONSTRUCT INPUT KNOWLEDGE BASE FILE:

1. Delimit clauses by line
2. Convert all clauses to disjuctive form
3. Use "~" to demarcate negated clauses
3. Add test clause to bottom of file

Example KB file:

~NoLeak ~LowTemp ReactorUnitSafe
~NoLeakH1 ~NoLeakH2 NoLeak
~okH1 NoLeakH1
okH1 V1 NoLeakH1
~okH2 NoLeakH2
okH2 V2 NoLeakH2
~I ~V1 ~V2 LowTemp
I ~V1 LowTemp
I ~V2 LowTemp
~I
~okH2
okH1
V1
~V2
LowTemp

NOTES ON EXAMPLE FILE:

LowTemp clause is being tested. All above clauses are part of the knowledge base

NOTES ON IMPLEMENTATION:

- Output file is generated by taking input file name, splitting it at the ".", and appending "out" to it.
